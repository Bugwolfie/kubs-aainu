# well the basics
# variables and datatypes covered
# variables are basically containerss
# who hold values and address inside them in form of various data types
# data types(system defned)
# 1. string 2. integers 3.float 4. booleans 5. none
# string can be written three ways 1. single quotation{''} 2. double quotation{""} 3. triple quotation{'" '"}

# python is damn smart that recognize all data types itself
# for example if we do this

# sorry thoda kam aa gya will do rest with you

# operators
# 1) arithmatic operators (+, -,*, /,%, //,**)

# are used to assign values to variables (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=,//=, )
